        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi. My name is Vickie Nguyen and I am currently a first year Pre-Business Major at the University of California, Riverside. I was born and raised in Monterey Park, California, and I went to Mark Keppel High School. I decided to major in business because I have always been interested in owning my own business one day. Growing up, I would always play different  business games where you could build your business from the bottom up and watch it prosper. I realized thatâ€™s what I want to do in life. Iâ€™d like to become an entrepreneur, but if that doesnâ€™t happen Iâ€™d like to work in human resources. The reason I am interested in human resources is because I enjoy interacting with people, and I am a strong believer that communication is key. I have many ideas of what I would like to do in the future, and I know for a fact that business is right for me.<br><br>

        My only professional experience is working as a receptionist at a nail spa. While working here, I was able to see what it was like to be in a work environment. My parents didnâ€™t allow me to get any other jobs because they wanted me to focus on school. To them, theyâ€™d rather have me put my all into school while I can, so itâ€™s more beneficial to me in the long run if I could land a good job. All throughout high school, I was involved in different clubs and sports. I was mostly involved in key club, globe club and tennis, but I briefly joined the track and field team for a year as well. I spent a lot of my weekends doing volunteer work and attending different meetings, as well as playing tennis and training with my friends at the local park courts. I was also in my class committee, where I would spend a lot of time trying to make the school a better environment for the students. Although I never held any leadership positions in high school, I know Iâ€™ve gained experience with handling different situations. 
<br><br>

        I would describe myself as a dedicated, hard-working person. I am extremely driven, and when I commit myself to something I always go through with it. When I was younger, my parents forced me to go to art, piano, and Chinese school. They thought by doing all these things it would be beneficial to me. I always dreaded going to school on the weekends and devoting a lot of time into these hobbies, but I did them anyways because I knew itâ€™d be good for me. I continued with these extracurriculars and additional education until they became a financial burden to my parents. I have many goals for my future, one of them being to give back to my parents for all theyâ€™ve sacrificed and done for me. I can definitely say Iâ€™ve expanded my knowledge and skills through these activities, and all of it is thanks to my parents. Family is everything to me, and I wouldnâ€™t be where I am today without them.
